Deneuve first came to prominence in Jacques Demy's 1964 film Les Parapluies de Cherbourg, before going on to star for Polanski in Repulsion (1965) and for Buñuel in Belle de Jour (1967) and Tristana (1970) She has won two César Awards for Best Actress for her performances in François Truffaut's Le Dernier Métro (1980) and Régis Wargnier's Indochine (1992).

Early life
Deneuve was born Catherine Fabienne Dorléac in Paris, France to French stage and screen actor Maurice Dorléac and actress Renée Simonot. Deneuve has two sisters, Françoise Dorléac (an actress, who died in a car crash in 1967, aged 25) and Sylvie Dorléac (born 1946),[3] and a maternal half-sister, Danielle b. 1937, from her mother's previous relationship with actor Aimé Clariond. Deneuve was her mother's maiden name, which she chose for her stage name, unlike her sister. Deneuve attended Catholic schools.

Film career
Deneuve was thirteen when she began her film career with a small role in André Hunebelle's Les Collégiennes (1957) with her younger sister Sylvie Dorléac, who acted in a few films casually as a child.[5] Deneuve was credited as Catherine Dorléac but subsequently used her mother's maiden name as her stage name in order to differentiate herself from her sisters.

After seeing Deneuve in L'Homme à femmes (1960), Jacques Demy cast her in his 1964 musical Les Parapluies de Cherbourg, the film that brought her to stardom.[5] Deneuve first portrayed the cold but erotic persona, for which she would be nicknamed the "ice maiden", in Roman Polanski's suspense classic Repulsion (1965), reinforcing it in Luis Buñuel's Belle de Jour (1967), and reaching a peak in Tristana (1970).[6] Her work for Buñuel would be her most famous.[7][8]

Further prominent films from this early time in her career included Jean-Paul Rappeneau's A Matter of Resistance (1966), and Demy's musical Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (1967). Deneuve remained active in European films during the 1960s and 1970s, though she limited her appearances in American movies of the period to The April Fools (1969), a romantic comedy with Jack Lemmon, and Hustle (1975), a crime drama with Burt Reynolds. Her starring roles at the time were featured in such films as Ça n'arrive qu'aux autres (1972) with Marcello Mastroianni and Le Sauvage (1975) with Yves Montand.

In the 1980s, Deneuve's films included François Truffaut's Le Dernier métro (1980), for which she won the César Award for Best Actress, and Tony Scott's The Hunger (1983) as a bisexual vampire, co-starring with David Bowie and Susan Sarandon, a role which brought her a significant lesbian following.[9] She made her debut film as a producer in 1988, Drôle d'endroit pour une rencontre.

In the early 1990s, Deneuve's more significant roles included 1992's Indochine opposite Vincent Perez, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and won a second César Award for Best Actress; and André Téchiné's two movies, Ma saison préférée (1993) and Les Voleurs (1996). In 1997, Deneuve was the protagonist in the music video for the song N'Oubliez Jamais sung by Joe Cocker. In 1998 she won acclaim and the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival for her performance in Place Vendôme. In the late 1990s, Deneuve continued to appear in a large number of films such as 1999's five films Est-Ouest, Le temps retrouvé, Pola X, Belle maman, and Le Vent de la nuit.
Deneuve in 1995

In 2000, Deneuve's part in Lars von Trier's musical drama Dancer in the Dark alongside Icelandic singer Björk was subject to considerable critical scrutiny. The film was selected for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. She made another foray into Hollywood the following year, starring in The Musketeer (2001) for Peter Hyams. In 2002, she shared the Silver Bear Award for Best Ensemble Cast at the Berlin International Film Festival for her performance in 8 Women. In 2005, Deneuve published her diary A l'ombre de moi-meme ("In My Own Shadow", published in English as Close Up and Personal: The Private Diaries of Catherine Deneuve); in it she writes about her experiences shooting the films Indochine and Dancer in the Dark. She also provided the voice role of Marjane Satrapi's mother in Satrapi's animated autobiographical film Persepolis (2007), based on the graphic novel of the same name.

Deneuve's more recent work includes Potiche (2010) and Les Bien-aimés (2011), in which she acts alongside her real-life daughter Chiara Mastroianni. During an interview at the Cannes Film Festival with Ali Naderzad, Deneuve was asked which was her own favorite film. "I still say it was The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. To do a film completely with music like an opera was an incredible experience. But to work with music all the time, it's such a lift, you know? It's an opera, it's very different."[10] Deneuve continues to work steadily making at least two or three films per year.
