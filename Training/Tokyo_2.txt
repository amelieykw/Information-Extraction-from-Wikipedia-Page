<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> (東京 Tōkyō?, "Eastern Capital") (Japanese: [toːkʲoː] ( listen), English /ˈtoʊki.oʊ/), officially <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> Metropolis (東京都 Tōkyō-to?),[5] is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan.[6] <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> Area, and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.[7] It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace, and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family. <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> is in the Kantō region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.[8] <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu?) and the city of <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> (東京市 Tōkyō-shi?).

<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> is often referred to and thought of as a city, but is officially known and governed as a "metropolitan prefecture", which differs from and combines elements of both a city and a prefecture; a characteristic unique to <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity>. The <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> metropolitan government administers the 23 Special Wards of <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> (each governed as an individual city), which cover the area that was formerly the City of <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> before it merged and became the subsequent metropolitan prefecture in 1943. The metropolitan government also administers 39 municipalities in the western part of the prefecture and the two outlying island chains. The population of the special wards is over 9 million people, with the total population of the prefecture exceeding 13 million. The prefecture is part of the world's most populous metropolitan area with upwards of 37.8 million people and the world's largest urban agglomeration economy. The city hosts 51 of the Fortune Global 500 companies, the highest number of any city.[9] The city is also home of various television networks like Fuji TV and the <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> Broadcasting System.

The city is considered an alpha+ world city—as listed by the GaWC's 2008 inventory[10]—and in 2014, <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was ranked first in the "Best overall experience" category of TripAdvisor's World City Survey (the city also ranked first in the following categories: "Helpfulness of locals", "Nightlife", "Shopping", "Local public transportation" and "Cleanliness of streets").[11] In 2013, <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was named the third most expensive city for expatriates, according to the Mercer consulting firm,[12] and the world's most expensive city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's cost-of-living survey.[13] In 2009 <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was named the third Most Liveable City by the magazine Monocle.[14] The Michelin Guide has awarded <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> by far the most Michelin stars of any city in the world.[15][16]

Etymology
<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was originally known as <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity>, which means "estuary".[17] Its name was changed to <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> (Tōkyō: tō "east" and kyō "capital") when it became the imperial capital in 1868,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital ('京') in the name of the capital city.[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was also called "Tōkei", an alternative pronunciation for the same Chinese characters representing "<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity>". Some surviving official English documents use the spelling "Tokei".[19] However, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]

The <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity>-to-<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> renaming was first suggested in 1813 in the book Kondō Hisaku (ja) (Secret Plan of Commingling), written by Satō Nobuhiro.[citation needed] When Ōkubo Toshimichi proposed the renaming to the government during the Meiji Restoration, according to Oda Kanshi,[vague] he got the idea from that book.

History
<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was originally a small fishing village named <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity>,[8] in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province.[21] <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity> was first fortified by the <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity> clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity> Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu made <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity> his base and when he became shogun in 1603, the town became the center of his nationwide military government. During the subsequent <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity> period, <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity> grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[22] <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> became the de facto capital of Japan[23] even while the emperor lived in <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto">Kyoto</entity>, the imperial capital. After about 263 years, the shogunate was overthrown under the banner of restoring imperial rule.

In 1869, the 17-year-old Emperor Meiji moved to <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity>. <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was already the nation's political and cultural center,[24] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo">Edo</entity> Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was established.

Central <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity>, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. This differs from many cities in the United States that are low-density and automobile-centric. Though expressways have been built in <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity>, the basic design has not changed.

<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century, but it recovered from both. One was the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing,[25] and the other was World War II.
1943–present

In 1943, the city of <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> merged with the "Metropolitan Prefecture" of <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity>.
<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> burning in 1945

The bombing of <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> in 1944 and 1945 killed 75,000 to 200,000 and left half of the city destroyed.[26]

After the war, <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was completely rebuilt, and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics. The 1970s brought new high-rise developments such as Sunshine 60, a new and controversial[27] airport at Narita in 1978 (some distance outside city limits), and a population increase to about 11 million (in the metropolitan area).

<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity>'s subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[28] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's "Lost Decade"[29] from which it is now slowly recovering.

<entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennozu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (now also a Shinkansen station), and the Marunouchi side of <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> Station. Buildings of significance are demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.

Land reclamation projects in <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[30] for transferring national government functions from <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, in order to slow down rapid development in <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[31] within Japan and have yet to be realized.

The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity>. However, due to <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity>'s earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[32] although activity in the city was largely halted.[33] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[34][35]

On September 7, 2013, the IOC selected <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. <entity name="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</entity> will be the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[36]
